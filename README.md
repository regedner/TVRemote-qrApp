# TV Remote QR Code Generator

This project is an Android application that generates a QR code for pairing a WebSocket-based remote controller with a smart TV. It was originally developed as part of a TV company's internal system, but all company-specific assets (such as logos) have been removed for public release. 

## Features

- Generates a QR code containing connection details for the WebSocket-based remote controller
- Automatically detects the local network IP address
- Ensures seamless pairing with the compatible remote controller application

## Requirements

- Android device running the application
- A compatible WebSocket-based remote controller app


## Limitations

- This application does not function as a standalone remote controller; it only facilitates pairing.
- Company-specific branding has been removed, requiring manual configuration for direct usage.
